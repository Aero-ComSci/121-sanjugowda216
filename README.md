The color stamp algorithm focuses on randomly choosing a clor from a list of colors and using the 'stamp' method. This leaves behind a stamp of the color. The algorithm then assigns the turtle back to its original color.

The shrink algorithm randomly chooses a value from a list of possible values for the turtle to challenge the player. Each time, the turtle shapesize method assigns a random value for the size of the turtle.

These functions are ultimately called as an algorithm in the clicked function. It is called when the timer is still running (the boolean value is false).
